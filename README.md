## 💡 About Me

I build **scalable, secure, and insight-driven platforms** that merge full-stack engineering with data infrastructure and AI/ML. With hands-on experience across **SaaS development, cloud systems, and predictive analytics**, I focus on delivering products that are both technically sound and business impactful.

From designing **real-time data pipelines** and deploying **Next.js + PostgreSQL apps** on Vercel, to optimizing **ML workflows in AWS/GCP**, I thrive in environments where **engineering, analytics, and product strategy intersect**.
