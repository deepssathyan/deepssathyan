## 🚀 Who I Am

A data-first thinker with a passion for transforming complexity into clarity.

Whether it's forecasting student engagement, designing KPI frameworks, or simulating full-funnel ad campaigns, I approach problems with structure, creativity, and precision.

With a strong foundation in cloud technologies, statistical modelling, and business intelligence, I strive to make data not just accessible but actionable.
